Blog Profesional.co.cr
==============

Here I present the code I use for my personal blog.   
It uses a combination of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com), plugins, configuration and my own customizations and changes to build it in the way I need to.   
This blog implements two languages (english and spanish), so it may be an interesting point you may want to see how I implemented this in Jekyll.

The actual site can be seeing in my [web development and programming blog](http://www.profesional.co.cr/).

To understand how this site is created and how I implemented the multilanguage, the blocks, search, rss feeds, sitemaps, responsive design, responsive menu, not found error, hosting in CDN and more you can look at the two series (in spanish and english) about this:
- [Why use Jekyll in my blog?](http://www.profesional.co.cr/jekyll/2014/02/03/why-use-jekyll-in-my-blog/)
- [¿Por qué usar Jekyll en mi blog?](http://www.profesional.co.cr/es/2014/01/27/por-que-usar-jekyll-en-mi-blog/)

Don't hesitake to drop me a line or contact me about any question.
