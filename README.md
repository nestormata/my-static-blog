Blog Profesional.co.cr
==============

Here I present the code I use for my personal blog.   
It uses a combination of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com), plugins, configuration and my own customizations and changes to build it in the way I need to.   
This blog implements two languages, so it may be an interesting point you may want to see how I implemented this in Jekyll.

The actual site can be seeing in [My Blog](http://profesional.co.cr/).
Don't hesitake to drop me a line or contact me about any question.
