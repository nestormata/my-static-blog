I love the Intel ads, mostly that one about rock stars, perhaps because since I got into the university I found so munch respect for some people and we always talk about X guy that invented this or that acomplish that, in some way we want to achieve things like that, like getting into Blizzard to work on games like Starcraft, I mean, those are our rock stars.
