Description
===
This is a session exposed for our team when we expose generally and theoretically about what is and what can be done with the Drupal Bootstrap.

The Drupal Bootstrap is indeed the base of the Drupal architecture and can be used in very interesting ways.
Besides, understanding how the Bootstrap works offers some basic knowledge that everyone working with Drupal should know.
